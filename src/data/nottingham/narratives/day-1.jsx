It is with much reluctance that we leave Edinburgh. A city with its shadows and whispers, its beauty and its sorrow, it has woven itself into our story. Though we depart, a part of us will remain, like the souls of those etched into its history, lingering in its streets, carried in its air.

We have walked through fortresses of war and halls of words, descended into vaults of the forgotten, stood before monuments to faith, tragedy, and transformation. Edinburgh is not just a city—it is a tale, and we have become part of it.

As we step forward, we carry its weight, its lessons, its echoes. History is not always beautiful—but it is always worth remembering.

With our luggage in hand, and King George perched like a watchful oracle, we move through the British countryside - a land that has seen kings rise and fall, revolutions ignite, poets dream, and travelers - such as ourselves, pass through, always searching for something beyond the horizon.
>“Ah, Edinburgh—city of spires and secrets, where even the air carries last words. You sentimental creatures speak of sorrowful partings and lingering echoes, but take heart. The dead do not mourn. They simply remain. I shall miss the scent of damp crypts and burnt offerings, the way the fog curls like a jealous lover around the ankles. But onwards we must trudge, into lands less blessed by the macabre—though I remain hopeful.

>Do not mistake this for closure. A city like Edinburgh does not release you—it clings, like guilt or old blood. You carry it with you whether you want to or not. But I digress. The road calls, and I suspect Nottingham has its own ghosts worth meeting. If not… I’ll make some.”`;
