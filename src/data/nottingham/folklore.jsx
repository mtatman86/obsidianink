## Legends & Folklore of Nottingham: As Told by _King George_

**Robin Hood – The Ghost of the Greenwood**  
"Ah, Robin Hood—the man, the myth, the master of poor decisions. Stealing from the rich to give to the poor? Admirable, in theory. Impractical, in practice. Some claim he still haunts Sherwood Forest, lingering among the oaks, waiting for history to declare its final verdict. If he does walk the shadows, I hope he’s pleased—his name is eternal, though whether his deeds were truly noble remains… subject to debate. Regardless, if you see a hooded figure vanish into the trees, do yourself a favor: leave the legend be. Some stories prefer to stay untold."

**The Caves Beneath**  
"Nottingham, unlike most cities, does not merely conceal its secrets—it carves them deep into the earth. Beneath its streets lie tunnels of old stone, where time itself seems hesitant to move. Merchants, criminals, survivors—each left their mark, though some marks refuse to fade. Voices where none stand. Footsteps without bodies to cast them. A place where history gathers in whispers and watchful eyes. If the city above is built on power, the city below is built on memory—though memory, I must remind you, does not always welcome guests."

**Mortimer’s Hole – A Treasonous Descent**  
"Ah, Mortimer—he who played the game of crowns, only to find the blade of retribution buried deep in stone. The passage through Nottingham Castle whispers of betrayal, the kind that earns a place in history and an echo in the walls. They say his screams still linger, clinging to the sandstone in quiet resentment. If true, he must be rather displeased. Perhaps next time, he will consider a profession less inclined toward executions."

**The Lady in the Window – Newstead Abbey**  
"Newstead Abbey—once a place of quiet devotion, later the home of Lord Byron, and somewhere between, the dwelling of a woman who never left. They call her the White Lady, standing at a window that no longer opens, watching something only she can see. Some claim she waits for a lost love. Others suspect her tragedy was far more cruel. I say, if one is doomed to remain, one should at least choose a more interesting vantage point."

**The Drummer Boy of Clifton**  
"Sent below the ground with nothing but his drum and instructions to beat a path forward. His rhythm echoed, slowed, then ceased. Never found, yet never forgotten. And now, beneath Clifton, the beat resumes—steady, unwavering, unwilling to accept silence. Was it the tunnels that took him, or the legend that refuses to let him go? No matter. If the drumming calls, it would be wise not to follow."

**The Hobgoblins of the Forest**  
"Ah, Sherwood’s mischievous little horrors—hobgoblins, spirits, tricksters of the trees. Not all legends are grand, not all shadows noble. Some whisper in laughter rather than lament, leading travelers astray, twisting paths, stealing whatever amuses them. Farmers once left offerings, bribing the unseen to spare their luck. And some still refuse to step among the oaks at night—perhaps out of superstition, perhaps out of wisdom. In either case, I approve—respect must always be paid to that which has no name, yet knows yours."

**The Ghosts of Clifton Hall**  
"A mansion with a history stretching back centuries, Clifton Hall has long been plagued by whispers of the unseen. Mysterious sounds, ghostly apparitions, and a lingering sense of unease have driven residents away—including a millionaire who fled after experiencing overwhelming paranormal activity. If the spirits here are restless, one must wonder—do they seek justice, or simply refuse to be forgotten?"

**The Phantom of the Galleries of Justice**  
"Justice may be blind, but it is never silent. The old courthouse, once the site of public executions, holds echoes of the condemned. A woman in Victorian dress appears in the halls, her presence felt in the cold air. Some say she was a prisoner, others claim she was a witness to injustice. Regardless, she lingers, watching, waiting—perhaps for a verdict that was never delivered."

**The Woman in White – Annesley Hall**  
"A tragic figure, seen wandering the grounds of Annesley Hall. Some say she was a noblewoman betrayed, others believe she was a servant wronged. Her presence is felt in the flickering candlelight, her sorrow pressing upon the air. If she seeks revenge, she will not find it here—Nottingham does not correct its sins; it merely remembers them."

**The Ghostly Rider of the A52**  
"A lone figure, seen upon the road, appearing and disappearing without warning. Some say he was a messenger, others claim he was a lost traveler. Regardless, he rides, his figure barely visible in the mist, his purpose forgotten. If one sees him, they should not follow—some journeys are not meant to be understood."

**The Wise Men of Gotham**  
"Ah, Gotham—the village of fools, or so the legend claims. When King John sought to build a road through their land, the villagers feigned madness, knowing that the crown avoided dealing with lunatics. Their antics—drowning an eel to prevent floods, fencing in a cuckoo to prolong summer—became infamous. But were they truly fools, or simply wise enough to outwit a king? I suspect the latter, though history does love its mockery."

**The Ghost of Will Scarlet – Sherwood Forest**  
"Robin Hood’s loyal companion, Will Scarlet, is said to haunt the depths of Sherwood Forest. Some claim to see his red cloak flickering through the trees, others hear whispers carried on the wind. If he lingers, does he seek vengeance, or merely the thrill of a battle long lost? Either way, I suggest one does not follow—some ghosts prefer their solitude."

**The Screaming Skull of Burton Agnes Hall**  
"A skull that refuses to be silenced. When Anne Griffith was murdered in the 17th century, her dying wish was to remain in her family home. Her skull was placed within the hall, but when attempts were made to remove it, the house was filled with unearthly screams. It remains there still, a grim reminder that some promises must be kept."

**The Black Dog of Blyth**  
"A shadow with glowing eyes, seen stalking the roads near Blyth. Some say it is an omen of death, others believe it is a guardian of the land. Regardless, those who see it rarely forget its presence. If it watches, it does so with purpose—though whether that purpose is mercy or malice remains unknown."

**The Devil’s Stone of Mapperley**  
"In Mapperley, a curious stone marks the spot where the Devil himself was said to have struck the earth in frustration. They say if you touch the stone, misfortune will follow. No one quite knows why the Devil came to Nottingham, but his visit left an imprint—both in rock and reputation."

**The Blackfriars Bridge Curse**  
"Blackfriars Bridge, crossing the Trent, is said to carry more than traffic—some say a curse. Built atop ancient grounds, it’s whispered that those who dare to linger too long hear distant tolling bells that herald misfortune. Travelers have reported sudden chills and fleeting shadows, as if the bridge itself remembers a betrayal long buried beneath its stones."

**The Grey Lady of Wollaton Hall**  
"Wollaton Hall, grand and proud, hosts a lady draped in mist and melancholy. Sightings say she wanders the grounds in grey silks, a ghost of a noblewoman lost to heartbreak or murder. Locals avoid the east wing after dusk—if only to spare themselves from her sorrowful wails and a chill that seeps into the bones."

**The Phantom Coach of the Forest Road**  
"Long before cars rattled down the Forest Road, a ghostly coach was seen racing through the trees. Drawn by headless horses and driven by a shadowy figure, it’s said to be a warning to travelers who dare the forest after dark. Those who glimpse it never reach their destination, lost forever to the wilds or the spirit world."

**The Devil’s Footprint of Mapperley Plains**  
"A scorched mark in the earth, the Devil’s footprint is a lingering scar on Mapperley Plains. Legend claims it was left when Old Nick stamped his foot in frustration after a game of cards with a local farmer. The mark burns when the devil’s near—and strange lights dance across the plains on moonless nights."

**The Singing Stones of Bramcote**  
"In Bramcote, some say the stones themselves sing when the wind is just right—a low, haunting melody that lures the curious. Those who follow the sound risk vanishing into the nearby woods, forever lost in the songs of the past. The stones guard secrets, and their music is both a warning and a temptation."

**The Lost Bell of St. Mary’s Church**  
"St. Mary’s once rang a bell so pure it was said to ward off evil. But it disappeared under mysterious circumstances, stolen or cursed, no one quite knows. Since then, the church has been plagued with strange happenings—echoes of bell tolls with no source, and shadows that twist unnaturally at dusk."

**The Hanging Oak of Sherwood**  
"Before the rise of the outlaw Robin Hood, Sherwood Forest held darker tales. The Hanging Oak was once the site of grim executions, where those who defied the crown met their end swaying in the wind. Some say the tree still mourns the souls it claimed, creaking with sorrow on cold nights."

**The Witch of Sutton-in-Ashfield**  
"A woman accused, condemned, and burned, yet her legend refuses to fade. The Witch of Sutton-in-Ashfield was said to curse those who wronged her, and even now, strange occurrences plague the land where she met her fate. If she lingers, it is not in sorrow—it is in defiance."
