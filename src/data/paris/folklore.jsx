## Phantom and Specters of Paris: As Told by _King George_

**The Phantom of the Opera – Palais Garnier**  
"Ah, a ghost with taste! If one must haunt a place, an opera house is a commendable choice. The whispers in the corridors, the fleeting shadow in the mirrors—how delightfully dramatic. Some claim a man once lived beneath the stage, tangled in obsession and secrecy. I must say, if the legend is true, he made rather poor use of his time. A life spent lurking? How dreadfully uninspired. Were it me, I would have ensured the world remembered my name in more fitting ways than whispers in gilded halls."

**The Catacombs – The Empire of the Dead**  
"Paris loves its grandeur, but beneath its streets lies something far less refined—six million souls stacked neatly in corridors where time no longer dares to tread. The Catacombs are no mere graveyard, they are an empire unto themselves, ruled by silence and shadows. Some claim the lost never return, swallowed by the dark. I say, if they do not return, perhaps they have simply found the company more agreeable than the world above."

**The Alchemist of Île de la Cité**  
"Nicolas Flamel, the elusive alchemist, said to have found the secrets of immortality. A pursuit most noble, though one must ask—if he succeeded, where is he now? Some claim he watches over Paris, guarding the mysteries of eternal life. A charming thought. But I, for one, do not envy him. Immortality is a poor gift if one must spend eternity keeping secrets rather than ruling."

**The Ghosts of Notre-Dame**  
"Priests, pilgrims, prayers left unanswered—Notre-Dame has seen centuries unfold, and still, the faithful linger, even beyond death. They kneel at invisible altars, their devotion refusing to wither. If there is anything to be learned here, it is that belief outlasts fire, outlasts ruin, and outlasts flesh itself. Admirable, yet terribly inconvenient for those who prefer a cathedral unburdened by phantoms."

**The Red Man of the Tuileries**  
"A royal assassin, betrayed and murdered, only to rise again as an omen of doom? Ah, now this is a ghost befitting a palace! The Red Man appears before revolutions, assassinations—whenever blood is due upon history’s ledger. Had he remained loyal to his task, perhaps France would have fewer tragedies to speak of. Instead, he warns of misfortune but does nothing to stop it—a rather passive approach to vengeance, though one cannot fault his consistency."

**The Lady in White – Parc Montsouris**  
"A woman in mourning, trapped within the park’s sorrowful embrace, wandering in search of a love lost beyond time. Tragic, yes, but I must question her persistence. Paris is vast, the world is wider—yet she remains, footsteps tracing the same futile path. They say her presence chills the air, her form a whisper among the trees. If she waits for something, I suggest she finds it sooner rather than later. Eternity is dreadfully tedious without purpose."

**The Devil's Door – Church of Saint-Sulpice**  
"A door forged under the weight of an unholy bargain—a pact sealed in craft, cursed in consequence. Those who passed through suffered misfortune, some never returning at all. Sensible minds sealed it shut, yet its legend remains, whispering of secrets left in stone. If the door was truly a gateway to ruin, I wonder—who was foolish enough to test it? Some men are too enamored with mystery to recognize danger, but history does tend to punish curiosity most cruelly."

**The Murmurs of Père Lachaise Cemetery**  
"A graveyard is a kingdom unlike any other—its rulers do not argue, its borders do not shift, and its subjects remain ever silent. Yet at Père Lachaise, silence is not quite absolute. Whispers drift between the tombs, shadows move without bodies to cast them, and some claim unseen hands reach from the dark. If one is to visit, best to remember—Paris adores its ghosts, and some adore the living a little too much."

**The Baker and Barber of Île de la Cité**  
"A tale of horror buried beneath the shadow of Notre-Dame. A barber and a baker, working in grim partnership—one slit throats, the other turned bodies into something far less recognizable. Their crimes were discovered when a loyal dog refused to leave its master’s last known location. Justice came swiftly, but their screams still linger in the night. If one walks Rue Chanoinesse alone, I would advise against listening too closely—some echoes are best left unheard."

**The Devil’s Gates of Notre-Dame**  
"A craftsman, desperate to prove his skill, made a bargain no mortal should ever make. The ironwork upon Notre-Dame’s doors is said to be the result of a pact with the devil himself—intricate, flawless, and cursed. Some claim those who linger too long near the gates feel an unnatural chill, as if unseen eyes watch from the shadows. If the legend is true, one must ask—was the price worth the craft?"

**The Tomb of Countess Demidoff**  
"A grave that refuses to remain undisturbed. The Countess Demidoff’s tomb, located in Père Lachaise Cemetery, is said to be cursed—those who attempt to open it suffer misfortune, and some claim to hear whispers from within. If she lingers, does she seek vengeance, or merely company? Either way, I suggest one does not test the patience of the dead."

**The Seine’s Unknown Lady**  
"A face frozen in sorrow, a mystery never solved. The death mask of a young woman, pulled from the Seine in the late 19th century, became an object of fascination—her serene expression captured in plaster, her identity forever unknown. Some claim her spirit still wanders the riverbanks, searching for the truth of her fate. If she does, I wonder—does she seek answers, or simply recognition?"

**The Haunted Mansion on Avenue Frochot**  
"A house where the living do not stay long. The mansion on Avenue Frochot has been plagued by eerie occurrences—objects moving on their own, whispers in the dark, and shadows that do not belong to the living. Some claim the spirits within are restless, others believe the house itself refuses to be forgotten. If one enters, best to remember—Paris does not always welcome its guests."

**The Ghosts of Versailles**  
"Ah, Versailles—the palace of grandeur, excess, and, of course, lingering spirits. Some claim to have seen Marie Antoinette herself, wandering the gardens, forever trapped in the moment before her downfall. Others speak of phantom courtiers, their whispers carried on the wind, discussing affairs long forgotten by the living. If Versailles is haunted, it is not by sorrow—it is by the echoes of a world that refused to fade."

**Rue des Chantres – The Street of Shadows**  
"A narrow, twisting street near Notre-Dame, known for its unsettling silence. In the 19th century, a boarding house here was struck by a deadly cholera outbreak, leaving its residents to perish in agony. Since then, passersby have reported strange figures, whispers in the dark, and an overwhelming sense of dread. If the dead remain, they do so with quiet resentment—Paris does not always grant its ghosts the luxury of peace."

**The Phantom Coach of Place de la Concorde**  
"A carriage drawn by black horses, appearing only on nights when history demands remembrance. Some say it carries the souls of those executed during the Revolution, their fate sealed beneath the guillotine’s blade. Others believe it is merely a spectral warning, a reminder that power, once wielded recklessly, always comes at a price. If one sees it, best to step aside—some journeys are not meant to be interrupted."

**The Beer-Loving Ghost of the Catacombs**  
"Among the six million souls buried beneath Paris, one stands apart—a man who, in 1793, ventured into the tunnels in search of a hidden brewery and never returned. His body was discovered eleven years later, and some claim his spirit still lingers, searching for the drink he never found. If one hears footsteps in the dark, perhaps it is merely a thirst that refuses to die."

**The Murmuring Mummies of the Louvre**  
"Ah, the Louvre—a museum of art, history, and, apparently, restless spirits. Some claim the Egyptian mummies housed within are not as silent as they seem, their presence felt in the shifting air, their whispers barely audible in the quiet halls. If they speak, what do they say? Warnings? Secrets? Or merely the echoes of a civilization that refuses to be forgotten?"

**The Sorcerer’s Rock – Le Rocher de la Sorcière**  
"A cursed stone, hidden in plain sight. Near Montmartre, a rock known as Le Rocher de la Sorcière is said to bring misfortune to those who touch it. Some claim it was once used in witchcraft rituals, others believe it marks the site of an ancient execution. Regardless, the legend persists—Paris does not forget its curses, and some stones carry more than history."

**The Marquise de Brinvilliers – The Poisoner of Paris**  
"A noblewoman turned murderer, her crimes woven into the city’s darkest history. The Marquise de Brinvilliers poisoned her own family, testing her deadly concoctions on the sick and the poor before perfecting her craft. When justice came, it was swift—she was beheaded and burned, her ashes scattered to the wind. Yet, some claim she lingers, her spirit bound to the streets where she once walked, watching, waiting. If she does, I suspect she enjoys the irony—Paris has never truly rid itself of poison."

**Belphegor – The Phantom of the Louvre**  
"A ghost among masterpieces, lurking in the halls of the Louvre Museum. Some say Belphegor, a demon of deception, haunts the corridors, whispering secrets to those who dare listen. Others believe the Egyptian mummies housed within are not as silent as they seem. If the Louvre is haunted, it is not by sorrow—it is by the weight of history refusing to be ignored."

**The Ghosts of Montmartre Cemetery**  
"A resting place for artists, poets, and dreamers, yet some refuse to sleep. Montmartre Cemetery is said to be haunted by shadowy figures, their presence felt in the shifting air, their whispers barely audible in the quiet alleys. If they linger, do they seek recognition, or merely the company of those who still remember them?"

**The Phantom Violinist of the Pont des Arts**  
"A haunting melody drifts across the Seine—delicate, mournful, and source unknown. Some say it is the spirit of a young violinist, drowned beneath the bridge after a failed romance. I say: if heartbreak is fuel for artistry, this ghost plays with the weight of centuries in every note. A pity the living rarely listen."

**The Grey Nun of Hopital des Enfants-Malades**  
"Not all hauntings are malicious. The ghost of a nun is said to tend to children at this old hospital, her silhouette glimpsed in quiet hours. Some call it mercy from beyond. I call it a reminder—duty, once bound in life, does not always unshackle in death."

**The Mad Scultor of Montparnasse**  
"A tormented artist, sculpting faces from memory… faces of the dead. When his sanity slipped, so did the line between creation and possession. They say the sculptures whisper after dark, mimicking breath where none exists. An art exhibit I most certainly approve of."

**The Screaming Skull of Rue Reaumur**  
"A townhouse long forgotten, where a skull was sealed behind a wall—still shrieking long after the bones were buried. Residents fled, the property condemned. Even the rats won’t linger. It’s said the skull belonged to a betrayed lover; I say it’s Paris itself, howling through stone."

**The Revenant of the Conciergerie**  
"The final stop before the guillotine. A prison echoing with the footsteps of those already sentenced by fate. Marie Antoinette is not the only one said to wander here—countless others murmur in chains, dragging regrets behind them like rusted cloaks. A fitting haunt for a raven’s stroll."

**The Phantom Fireman of Montmartre**  
"They say a fireman lost in a blaze still climbs the hills of Montmartre, searching for those to save. He knocks at doors that no longer open, enters buildings long since ash. A hero’s spirit, perhaps—but I wonder: whom does he seek to rescue, and from what?"

**The Bell-Ringer of Saint-Eustache**  
"The bells once rang out for plague, war, and salvation. Now they toll for no one. Yet some say a shadowy figure still climbs the belfry to pull the rope. A ghost devoted to rhythm? Or a warning in disguise? Regardless, I suggest not answering if the bells toll for you."
