On days of departure, reflection is inevitable.

Today feels especially bittersweet—not merely a moment to look back on the myths, legends, and history of Paris, but to reckon with the entire journey we’ve shared.

Our companion, King George—the sassy, sarcastically morbid raven we stumbled upon in Glasgow—has spent these last two weeks perched beside us, offering sharp-witted commentary and darkly humorous asides on the stories that swirled around us. He became more than a shadowy observer. He became one of us.

Now, he sits on the windowsill, wings slightly puffed, sighing with theatrical weight. The shadows of the city cast long behind him. Somewhere behind that feigned indifference, he is mourning. But pride won’t let him admit he doesn’t want us to leave.

We pack in silence, pretending the sadness isn’t there. Souvenirs are tucked away with hands that linger too long, smiles remembering each place, each echo, each step through haunted corridors and gilded halls.

The last bag zipped. The moment comes.

I kneel before him, arm outstretched. He hops forward without hesitation, talons curling into familiar fabric. He perches upon my shoulder—just as he has at every stop, every ruin, every cathedral.

The relief in his eyes is fleeting, but not unnoticed. I scratch his head gently.

We are ready for the journey home.
>“I knew you’d never leave me behind,” he murmurs, voice low and layered with feeling, though touched with his usual sardonic flair. 

>“You’ve carried me through history, through legends, through shadows and light. I’m not meant to stay—I’m meant to go where you go.

>You’ve called me watcher, storyteller, shadow on your shoulder. But I am more than that. I’ve seen the world in ways I never imagined. I’ve perched atop the bones of empires, watched the tides of time shift beneath my wings. And now... I’ve traveled with you—not as a ghost, but as something real. Something bound.

>Your story is a legend waiting to be told around bonfires—tales of love, ruin, wonder, and, of course, me. This journey has shaped me, just as I’ve come to understand how bound I am to you. You need me... as much as I need you. No tower, no crypt, no cathedral could ever replace that.”

As we step into the airport, Paris recedes behind us. The Seine grows still. The shadows dim.

But King George—our companion, our oracle, our sharp-tongued, steadfast friend—continues the journey, right there with us, carrying the stories home.

There’s still more to see.`;
