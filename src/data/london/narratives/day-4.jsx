London stretches beyond the window, its skyline dissolving into mist and memory. The hum beneath its streets is still there, pulsing beneath our departure, as if the city itself refuses to fade.

We have walked through history and mystery, from the shadows of the Tower of London to the blood-stained streets of Whitechapel, from the echoes of lost legends to the lingering notes of Phantom of the Opera.
>“We’ve seen things London doesn’t want us to remember. And yet, here we are—watching it all slip away like a well-kept secret.”

Before we depart, we take in London’s icons one last time:
Big Ben – The clock that has measured time for generations, standing as a silent witness to history.
>"Time moves forward, but these streets keep their ghosts. Tick-tock, tick-tock—London never really lets anyone go."

Westminster Abbey – A place of coronations, funerals, and whispered secrets, where kings and poets alike rest beneath its towering arches.
>"They say the dead don’t speak. They’re wrong. Some places hold conversations long after the voices are gone."

Horse Guards Parade – The grand ceremonial ground where the Household Cavalry’s horses gleam beneath the sun, riders in crimson and silver stand like statues come to life, and the clang of hooves echoes tradition and power.
>"A spectacle of discipline and pageantry, where history and ceremony gallop side by side, reminding the city that some things never change."

And just across the way, St. Pancras International, the station whose grand façade was used in the films, where Harry and Ron’s flying Ford Anglia took off into the sky.
>"Escaping London through magic or trains—two paths, same destination. Either way, something is always left behind."

There’s a certain charm in this place, a portal not just for trains but for imaginations—a tribute to a world where spells replace schedules and the impossible takes flight. The magic of Harry Potter lingers here, a reminder that even in a city built on stone and history, wonder finds a way to sneak in.

From here, we board the Eurostar, bound for Paris.

London remains behind, yet it is never truly left—its stories woven into memory, its history now a part of us.
>"Some places stay with you. London doesn’t just linger—it waits, watching, whispering through the cracks of time."

Paris awaits, not with echoes of lost kings, but with boulevards built for artists, cathedrals standing in defiance, and streets that carry poetry in their breath.
>"London whispers its secrets. Paris sings them."

The skyline draws closer—the iron lattice of the Eiffel Tower, the spires of Notre Dame, the grandeur of the Louvre, each standing like a promise of discovery.
>"New ghosts, new echoes, new stories waiting in the quiet corners of the city."

As the wheels slow and the platform nears, London fades into memory—and Paris opens its arms to what comes next.
