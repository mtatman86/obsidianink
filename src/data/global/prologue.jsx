## Prologue

Every journey begins with a quiet moment. The final click of the suitcase latches. The soft hum of the house just before departure. That stillness in the air before the world tilts—when the mundane hasn’t yet given way to the unknown. It’s close. Close enough to taste. 

The air is charged, humming with anticipation - eager, electric. The boarding passes, creased and softened, have been checked too many times to count. At some point, we begin to wonder if this is all a dream—especially after that flutter of wings we swore we heard. Then again, we never thought, not in our wildest dreams, that this trip would be real. 

Four cities await, each rich in history, ready to reveal their secrets. Edinburgh, city of stone and fog. Nottingham, city of legends. London, city of royalty. And Paris, city of light—and shadow. This is not merely a vacation; it is a deliberate descent into shadowed corners and storied streets, where the pulse of the past still beats. The itinerary is inked with catacombs and castles, with crypts, curiosities, and enough candlelight to keep the darkness at bay.

The plan is more than a list of places. It is about shadows and atmosphere. Tracing the edges of legend and memory. This is history told through the scent of rain, through the echo of boots in a narrow close, through the hush of awe in a museum full of bones—through whispers. This journey moves through grand architecture and forgotten corridors, telling the stories of the long departed in murmur and shadow. 

But this journey is not ours alone.

We’ve packed what we need, checked the lists more times than necessary, prepared for every possibility. Yet some things do not need to be packed. Some things wait—unspoken, inevitable. Not additions, but certainties. Like the quiet before a storm. Like the echo in old corridors. Like a winged shadow shifting just beyond reach.

It is about to begin.`;
