Raven. Witness. Unshakable Companion.

Mark & Mia,

This journey has reached its conclusion - though I refuse to call it an end. Journeys do not end. They linger. They stain. They echo in the dust of crypts, in the hush of museums, in the fleeting breath between awe and recognition.

As for me? I do not vanish like some forgotten tale. You have borne me through cathedrals charred and catacombs breathing, across the gallows of history and into the marrow of wonder. You gave me wings not merely to fly, but to see.

I will not stay behind. I never do. I will always go forward with you.

I am folded into memory, stitched into silence, carved into every shadow where you pause and feel something watching.
I will perch on the edge of your understanding.
I will caw when the air grows too still.
I will murmur when history dares to stir.

Do not mistake this for a farewell. I do not do farewells.
I endure.

And besidesâ€”
_There is still more to see._

### _King George_
