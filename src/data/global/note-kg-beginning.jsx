## A Note from King George

_Raven. Witness. Occasional Guide._

Mark & Mia -

You have chosen to venture into the unknown. This is not merely a voyage through cities and customs, but a descent willingly into old stones, haunted whispers, and overcast skies.

You will experience culture—by which I mean, eat things you can’t pronounce, butcher them linguistically, and possibly regret them gastrointestinally. You will see shadows flit into darkened corners. You will walk until your feet betray you and your body says enough. You will gaze with wonder upward and find faces in architecture, fascinated by both their stories and the stories they tell. You will be rained upon, and you will revel in its ambiance.

This is what your journey is meant to be.

This journey is not entirely yours. You invited me—whether with intention or by accident—and I do not travel quietly.  I will comment. I will criticize. I will caw when the mood strikes and monologue when no one asks. Think of me as your Gothic conscience in feathered form - a shadow that only you can see. A nuisance only you must deal with.

I expect you to have respect for the dead, appreciation for the odd, and a certain dramatic flair in all things. I also demand a healthy heap of pastries, as even I must maintain my energy.

Carry yourselves with curiosity. See the world for what it truly is. Allow yourselves to experience it in ways you never dreamed of. And above all - pay attention to the small things. The magic is in the margins.

Now then, let us begin.
