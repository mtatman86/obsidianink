## Whispers of the Old Town: As Told by _King George_

**The Mackenzie Poltergeist**  
"George Mackenzie—a man so consumed by cruelty that even the grave refused him peace. His resting place, the infamous Black Mausoleum, now serves as his final stage, where he performs the same wretched fury he once unleashed upon the living. Visitors claim they leave scratched, bruised, or utterly undone, and I say—well done, Mackenzie. You were a tyrant in life; at least you remain consistent. Though I must wonder, does eternity tire a man so devoted to rage? No matter. Edinburgh belongs to its ghosts, and Mackenzie is simply fulfilling his duty."

**Burke and Hare – The Resurrection Men**  
"Ah, ingenuity at its most disgraceful. When grave-robbing proved too tedious, Burke and Hare simply expedited the process—why steal corpses when one can create them? A business model both disturbing and oddly efficient. Their downfall was inevitable, of course—men who work with death always meet it personally. Burke hanged, Hare vanished, and Edinburgh kept the receipts. The city does not forget its monsters, and if Hare still walks among us, I do hope he enjoys the legacy he carved so violently into history."

**The Drummer Without a Head**  
"To die is one thing. To die and remain employed? Quite another. This headless drummer boy persists in his eternal task, warning the castle of impending doom. His beat was heard before Cromwell’s siege, before fire tore through the halls. Should I hear it myself, I would waste no time making arrangements elsewhere. Death, after all, is rarely as punctual as its heralds—but one should never test the schedule."

**Annie’s Room**  
"A child abandoned in plague, her sorrow left to ferment in the forgotten corners of Mary King’s Close. A tragic tale, undoubtedly, but one must wonder—what does she seek now? She has her gifts, piles of toys left by those who pity her fate. Yet still, she lingers, her presence felt in the heavy air, her sadness refusing to dissipate. A stubborn spirit, she is. I cannot say I blame her—Edinburgh does love its ghosts, and some have simply learned to return the affection."

**The Vaults Beneath**  
"History may claim that the South Bridge Vaults were once a center of trade, but trade implies civilization, and what lurks in those tunnels is anything but. Smugglers, thieves, the unwanted—Edinburgh has a habit of misplacing its sinners, and here, they accumulated until the walls themselves absorbed their misery. Some say the air moves when there is no wind, that hands grasp in the dark without flesh to guide them. If such tales hold truth, I suggest one does not linger. Whatever resides there remembers the living, but it has long forgotten what it means to be among them."

**The Witches’ Well**  
"A fountain, delicately designed to honor those burned alive at the castle’s edge—how quaint. The trials were absurd, the executions swift, and the paranoia relentless. How easily men turn fear into spectacle! Their guilt was decided long before the flames took hold, their fates nothing more than formalities. And now, only water remains, flowing in silent protest of crimes uncorrected. I wonder, when the city sleeps, does it hear them still? If so, it is wise not to listen too closely."

**The Ghost Piper**  
"Sent into the tunnels beneath the castle, his pipes meant to lead the way, yet his tune faded, and so did he. Simple mathematics—one boy enters, none return. And yet, the melody remains, drifting upward through the stone on windless nights. A lament? A warning? Perhaps merely a song too stubborn to cease. Regardless, Edinburgh listens, as it always does. Not all echoes belong to the past—some insist on repeating until the present acknowledges them."

**The Heart That Spits Back**  
"A prison long gone, yet the heart remains—a mosaic marking a place where justice was often mistaken for convenience. The condemned met their end here, and tradition dictates that locals spit upon its stones in defiance. A charming gesture, truly, though if superstition holds weight, I suggest caution. Some claim the heart still beats, watching those who walk across its remains. And if one should hear it? Well—perhaps it is better not to linger."

**The Ghost of the Grey Lady – Edinburgh Castle**  
"A figure draped in sorrow, wandering the halls of Edinburgh Castle. Some say she was a noblewoman, others claim she was a prisoner. Regardless, she lingers, her presence felt in the cold air, her whispers lost to time. If she seeks justice, she will not find it here—Edinburgh does not correct its sins; it merely remembers them."

**The Cannibal of Queensberry House**  
"A tale so grotesque that even Edinburgh hesitates to speak of it. A young noble, locked away in Queensberry House, was left unattended during a riot. When his family returned, they found him feasting upon a servant—his hunger unrelenting, his humanity abandoned. The house still stands, but some claim the echoes of his madness remain. If one listens too closely, they may hear the sound of teeth upon bone."

**The Phantom of the West Bow**  
"A merchant, cursed by greed, doomed to wander the West Bow. His presence is felt in the flickering lanterns, the sudden chill in the air. Some say he seeks redemption, others believe he merely enjoys the torment. Regardless, his footsteps remain, pressing upon the cobblestones like a shadow that refuses to fade."

**The Screaming Prisoners of the Tolbooth**  
"Once, the Tolbooth held Edinburgh’s condemned—men and women who awaited their fate in the darkness. Their screams were heard in the night, their pleas ignored. The building is gone, but the voices remain. If one walks past its former site, they may hear them still, whispering of justice that never came."

**The Ghostly Rider of Arthur’s Seat**  
"A lone rider, seen upon the slopes of Arthur’s Seat, galloping toward a destination unknown. Some say he was a messenger, others claim he was a soldier lost to war. Regardless, he rides, his figure barely visible in the mist, his purpose forgotten. If one sees him, they should not follow—some journeys are not meant to be understood."

**The Faceless Woman of the Royal Mile**  
"They say she was once admired, a beauty among the stone and soot. But admiration curdled into envy, and her face was stolen—cut away, erased, or perhaps simply forgotten. Now, she wanders the Royal Mile with a veil of shadow where her features should be. If she draws near, don’t scream—she cannot see you, but she listens. And the faceless, I’ve found, are always eager to borrow what they lack."

**Major Weir: The Wizard of West Bow**  
"Ah, Major Thomas Weir—the preacher with a holy tongue and a hell-bound soul. By daylight, a man of god. By night, a man of far darker devotions. He confessed to sorcery, incest, and blasphemy, aided by a walking stick said to move of its own accord. They burned him, of course, but the flames failed to erase the stench of his sins. His home remained untouched for years, avoided even by vermin. I admire consistency in a villain, and Weir? He was unwavering."

**The Gorbals Vampire**  
"A detour to Glasgow, if you’ll indulge me. 1954. A tall creature with glowing eyes and iron teeth stalked the Southern Necropolis, devouring children—or so the whispers claimed. Armed with stakes and crucifixes, the local youth descended on the graveyard like a pint-sized lynch mob. Madness? Perhaps. But monsters wear many faces, and fear, as always, finds its form. If he ever existed, I salute his theatricality."

**The Banshee of Calton Hill**  
"Above the monuments, where the wind rarely rests, a sound pierces the mist—a cry not born of throat or lung, but of something older, more mournful. The banshee sings on Calton Hill. Some claim she heralded the fall of a noble house, others say she weeps for the city itself. Whatever her purpose, she sings still. Grief, like granite, endures."

**The Stone Circle Beneath Princes Street Gardens**  
"Before the trains, the gardens, the whispering trees—there were stones. A circle of them, ancient and precise. Buried now, of course, lost beneath the city’s polished exterior. But on certain mornings, when the fog hangs low and the air feels… watchful, some claim to see figures pacing in perfect formation. Rituals unfinished. Tongues unspoken. If you hear them—walk faster."
