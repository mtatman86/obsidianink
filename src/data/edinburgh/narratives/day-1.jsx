Today marks the beginning of something extraordinary.
Not just a trip. Not merely a change in scenery. A crossing. A quiet severing from the everyday. The flights have carried us through unfamiliar time zones, across the sea, through weary hours—delivering us first to Iceland, then onward to Glasgow. But the journey doesn’t truly begin here. It waits—just ahead, in Edinburgh.
We linger at the bus station, hungry and restless. Tired of sitting, we wander in search of a snack. The air is heavy—but not with dread. It’s the hush before something remarkable. A pause. As if the world itself has held its breath in anticipation.
And then—he appears.

A raven. Of course. But not just any raven.
This one is far larger than he ought to be, posture proud, eyes intelligent in a way that is slightly unsettling. He fluffs his obsidian feathers, and upon his head rests a crown—tarnished, ridiculous, undeniable. It catches no light, yet draws the eye all the same.
He makes no sound. Not even a caw. He stares—directly at us. Expectantly.
He hops forward, eyes flicking toward the snack in our hands.
A silent negotiation takes place. We offer him some. He accepts, as if accepting tribute.

And just like that, he is ours. Or perhaps—we are his.
His name arrives like a whisper on the wind: King George. Fitting. How we know, we cannot say. But when we speak it aloud, he cocks his head in approval.
He does not speak—not yet. But his presence speaks volumes.
There is authority in his gaze. The air around him leans towards theatrical. He is a witness. A judge. A critic with feathers. Some kind of avian Gothic conscience. As if he has lived as long as time itself.

His silence, however, does not last. He will offer commentary—whether we want it or not. Morbid history, unsolicited wisdom, and frequent disdain for modern nonsense. He claims he needs nothing from us, yet the relief in his eyes is clear. Someone finally saw him. Someone finally listened.
And now we are three.

Two travelers, stepping into a world of ghosts, legends, and storm-swept cobblestones… And a raven with a crown, determined not to be left behind. `;
